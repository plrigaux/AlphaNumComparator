# Comparators

This is a library that provide different type of comparators. 

## History

This project started with the idea do create a version of a "Natural Comparator" that can be 
configured according to different needs or contexts. During the development other types of comparators came up
and I decided to implemented them as well.

For now here the implemented comparators.

* [Natural Order Comparator](NaturalOrderComparator.md): A configurable comparator that sort strings with 
numerical component in the natural order.

* [White Space Comparators](WhiteSpaceComparators.md): Different comparators that handle white space.
